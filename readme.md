# Custom Masonry Layout

## Introduction

Make a masonry layout with reference to [masonry-layout](https://github.com/desandro/masonry) and [simple-masonry-layout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-masonry-layout). The marsony.js is only to calculate the position and size of each grid items but not do the render part. 

The calculated result is up to you to render them on screen. I think it is easy to adapt to React, Vue, etc.

## Time complexity

$O(n^{m})$ where n is the number of items, m is the number of columns.
